# End-to-End SQL Data Warehouse & Analytics Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a **complete SQL-based data warehouse** following a **Bronze-Silver-Gold layered ETL pipeline**. It covers data ingestion, cleaning, transformation, aggregation, and the creation of fact and dimension tables. Analytics-ready views are provided for business intelligence and reporting.

The project showcases practical skills in **SQL/T-SQL, ETL processes, data modeling, and analytics**, making it ideal for **Data Analyst, BI Analyst, or Data Engineer roles**.

## Pipeline & Architecture

**Bronze Layer (Raw Staging):**
- Load raw data from source systems (CSV or ERP tables) into staging tables.
  
**Silver Layer (Cleaned & Transformed):**
- Apply data cleaning, normalization, and enrichment.
- Join tables and implement business logic.

**Gold Layer (Fact & Dimension Tables):**
- Create fact tables (e.g., `fact_sales`) and dimension tables (e.g., `dim_customer`) for analytics.
- Optimize for querying and reporting.

**Analytics-Ready Views:**
- Build aggregated views for dashboards and insights.
- Supports KPI calculations, sales analysis, and customer segmentation.
